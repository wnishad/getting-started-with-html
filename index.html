<b> (only the important stuff)</b>
<h3>What is HTML?</h3> html stands for <b><em>hypertext markup language</em></b>, which is a standardized system for font, color, graphic, and other effects on web pages.
<br>HTML is made up of
<br>&nbsp&nbsp-text content
<br>&nbsp&nbsp-markup (aesthetic)
<br>&nbsp&nbsp-references to (images, media, etc.)
<br>&nbsp&nbsp-links
<h3>HTML basics</h3>
<b>What is a tag?</b>
<br>A tag tells the computer how to format and display the information in the way you want it to.
<br>Tags start with an opening tag and end with a closing tag, telling the computer what exactly should be formatted in what way. For example, I have formatted these notes with header tags to make the title and headers bigger and bold.
<br>I can also add images using tags, like this: <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1O_BurwMxdg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/BhcNppmcELo/photo.jpg?sz=50"> <b><em>#freeguwop</em></b>
<br>An image tag is an example of a tag that doesn't need a closing tag because it's not modifying a pre-existing element. Rather, it is adding a new one.
<br><br><b>What is an attribute?</b>
<br>An attribute modifies elements in HTML to suit a specific purpose. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute">link</a> is a type of a attribute.
